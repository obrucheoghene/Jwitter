Jwitter is a Twitter clone web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. It allows users to create accounts, post tweets, follow other users, like tweets, and perform other common Twitter functionalities.

I've been long intrigued by the idea of creating a Twitter clone that incorporates some of Twitter's innovative features. This curiosity ultimately drove me to develop Jwitter.

With Jwitter, I have effectively implemented key features and functionalities that are comparable to Twitter's. Users can currently register, login, post tweets, reply to tweets, like and unlike tweets, follow and unfollow other users, as well as receive notifications.
